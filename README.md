# Python-scripts

These are just some Python scripts I used to complete CTF's for the cybersecurity bootcamp I completed at Fullstack Academy.
I decided to create a GitHub as a way to store my scripts, and potentially help users out in the world.
This is also a way for me to start using GitHub and to continue building my coding skills and knowledge base, by adding new scripts

Thanks!
