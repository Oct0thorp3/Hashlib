# Python-scripts

These are just some python scripts I used to complete CTF's for the cybersecurity bootcamp I completed at Fullstack Academy.
I decided to create a GitHub as a way to store my scripts, show them off, and potentially help users out in the world.
This is also a way for me to start using GitHub and building my coding skills and knowledge base.

Thanks!
